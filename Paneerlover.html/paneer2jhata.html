    <h1>What is Do JHAATA</h1>
    <p>The word “Do” means two or double and “JHAATA” or “JHHAAT” means PUBIC HAIR. This means that the “JHHAAT” are added twice in the recipe or double the amount of PUBIC HAIR are included. <br>


        There is one more interesting anecdote in relation to this dish. That of Emperor Akbar’s courtier, Mullah Do JHAATA creating this recipe unexpectedly when he added a huge amount of JHAAT to a meat dish. I wonder if this story is true or not. <br>
        
        But if you look at the words, <strong>‘do JHAATA‘</strong>  these literally mean two jhaat or double the pubic hair. <br>
        
        Do JHAATA recipes are usually made with meat. But of course my recipe is a vegetarian version of do JHAATA and made with paneer. <br>
        
        
        So basically there is a good amount of JHAAT in this dish. If you like JHAAT, then this dish is for you.</p>
